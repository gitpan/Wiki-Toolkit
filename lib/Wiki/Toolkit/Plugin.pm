=head1 NAME

Wiki::Toolkit::Plugin - A base class for Wiki::Toolkit plugins.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides methods for accessing the backend store, search and formatter
objects of the L<Wiki::Toolkit> object that a plugin instance is
registered with.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package Wiki::Toolkit::Plugin::Foo;
  use base qw( Wiki::Toolkit::Plugin);

  # And then in your script:
  my $wiki = Wiki::Toolkit->new( ... );
  my $plugin = Wiki::Toolkit::Plugin::Foo->new;
  $wiki->register_plugin( plugin => $plugin );
  my $node = $plugin->datastore->retrieve_node( "Home" );

=head1 DECLINING ACTIONS FROM PRE_ METHODS

  Note: This functionality is missing for pre_retrieve

  It is possible for the pre_ methods (eg C<pre_write>) to
  decline the action. This could be due to an authentication
  check done by the plugin, due to the content, or whatever else
  the plugin fancies. There are three possible return values from
  a pre_ plugin:

  C<-1> - Deny this action
  C<0> or C<undef> - I have no opinion
  C<1> - Allow this action

  If you have only zeros, the action will be allowed. If you have ones
  and zeros, it will also be allowed.

  If you have minus ones and zeros, it will be denied. If you have minus
  ones, ones and zeros, the sum will be used to decide. 

  For default deny, have one plugin return -1, and another only return 1 
  if the action is explicity allowed)

      my $class = shift;
      my $self = bless {}, $class;
      $self->_init if $self->can("_init");
      return $self;
  }

Generic contructor, just returns a blessed object.

    return $self;
}

=item B<wiki>

Returns the Wiki::Toolkit object, or C<undef> if the C<register_plugin>
method hasn't been called on a L<Wiki::Toolkit> object yet.

C<register_plugin> method hasn't been called on a L<Wiki::Toolkit> object
yet, or if the wiki object had no search object defined.
